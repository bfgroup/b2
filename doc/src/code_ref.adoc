[[b2.reference.code]]
= Implementation Reference

This includes reference documentation for the internals of the B2 engine code.
Even though the Jam facing build system interfaces are also implemented in the
engine, they are documented in the general reference section. This goes deeper
and includes parts of engine mechanism and data structures. It is meant for
those making changes to the engine itself.
